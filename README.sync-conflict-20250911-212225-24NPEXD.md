# zTank
Tank survey, embedded sofware on dedicated PCB using ESP32C6 ÂµC

## Requirements

## Usage
 - short press button to join the zigbee network (coordinator shall grant pairing) -> LED shall flash, until network is joined, it then shutoff
  - long press button to leave network. When the LED is fixed on, the device is not connected to the network neither is trying to join


## Build Instructions

git submodule add https://github.com/akira215/esp-ash-components.git components
```
Create a partition.csv for zigbee and configure menuconfig with custom partition table

## Current Status

Still work in progress, but is completely running. All bugs 
could be reported to try to improve it.
